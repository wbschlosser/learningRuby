#Rules for if statments
# 1.If statements should have an else
# 2.If the else should never run because it doesn't make sense
#	use a 'die' function to print an error message and die (see e35)
# 3. Never nest them more than 2 deep, always try for 1 deep only
# 4. Treat them like paragraphs, if-elsif-else with blank lines
#	before and after them
# 5. Boolean tests should be simple. Move complex calculations to
#	variables earlier in the function. Use good naming

#Rules for Loops
#1. use while loops only to loop forever, this only applies to ruby
#2. use for loops for all other looping, especially if there is a
#	fixed or limited number of things to loop over

#Debugging tips
# 1. Don't use one in ruby. They are overkill apparently
# 2. The best way is to use put to print out variables at points in the
#	program to see where they go wrong.
# 3. Code a little, run a little, fix a litte. Dont write big programs
#	all at once
